# Thermocouple-Simulator
A small thermocouple simulator to test specific thermocouple voltage response for specific temperatures.
It has capabilities such as finding the best thermocouple suited for given temperature range automatically,
user adjusted temperature step (variable simulation accuracy), supports 8 thermocouple types and even more capabilities
